# BT5153_Group4_Final_Project
Final Project for the NUS course BT5153 - Music Genre Classification

Datasets:
1. "3593_song_features_genre_dataset.csv" was used for all models except RNN
2. Datasets used for RNN are stored in "Time_series_dataset_for_RNN.zip"

Codes:
1. MLModels.ipynb consists of all models except the Neural Network models
2. Neural Network models are stored in the folder "Neural Network"
3. Code for Exploratory Data Analysis are stored in the folder "EDA"
4. LIME, PFI for XGBoost and Random_Forest models are stored in the folder "XAI"

Our conclusion includes moving forward with the Neural Network model titled "Neural Network.py" stored in Code > Neural Network. This model has the highest accuracy and f1_scores.
